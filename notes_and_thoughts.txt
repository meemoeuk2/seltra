consider upgrading blockmap should be upgraded to a OBjectMap
 thingmap should be able to reference multipul objects per location.
 each location can either be a list ( bucket )
 or each object can stack on existing things and link to what its sat on.
  ' this should be prefable since we don't expect large stacks
 consider a priority stack, or just first come first stacked stack
 
 * maybe not necessary, do we need map access to generator?
   - generators can function subjectively ( as daemons ) , since objects do not talk to them
