currently the code is configged towards 'lego bricks' rather than 'chemical bricks'
 not sure this is best, but really we could use both


try move code towards that falling trash game we had in blitzplus

 get a handle on the paintbox

 mouse select of paintbox is currently using  blind constant to guess where
  paintbox items end. 
  Use a counter while items are being intiated

 new block code is lacking because up till now the only block adds have been user mouse click


 blist vs bgroup vs barray
 are they all necessary? or can we cut back to 2, or 1?
 a blist is another name for a barray
  so their are only 2 types

 can barrays and bgroups be combined?
 a bgroup is a wrapper around a barray

actually realtime generator adding will not be as hard as 1st thought, to 


we are using an map type that is remembering all its keys and values
 this essentially can give access to all thing and objects 
 yet we are also using objects to remember the keys and values
  could we trim somthing down?

 could all data of an object be stored in a single int?
  - wouldn't need to use objects
  - just a single thingmap
  - things would have to be processed out of order of object type, which may lead to problems
  - would need to write a encoder and a decoder to get info in and out of the int
    - but this should be pretty simple, and worth it for a single intmap
  - also this would make use of the key array, which is currently redundant due to object lists
  - there are a lot of object lists and this is complicated

 thingmaps block handling won't work until blockgroup arrays are implemented
  - we have 3 longs per block
   - the index ( pref not used )
   - the key ( can use )
   - the value ( can use )
   so do we need a seperate a blockgroup array?
   - the index can be just used for block groups, since blocks can never act independantly of their groups
    - a reference to the index can be in the value or key
     -  of course index cannot reference many values


 thingblocks shouldn't use new map index if they are moving to an empty block
 thing value needs a 'hasmoved this frame' flag

 jumping problem with  'grave' cells
  because index list array entry is not being deleted, so when a foreign block enters the grave cell
   its updated by the ghost of the dead block
    
   adding the index to the key will allow deletion of indexed blocks from selected cells
    ok do it, key long is highly redundant
